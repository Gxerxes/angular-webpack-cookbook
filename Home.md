> **Work in progress!** We welcome feedback at [our issue tracker](https://github.com/dmachat/angular-webpack-cookbook/issues).

Inspiration for, and much of the webpack content in this cookbook comes from [christianalfoni/react-webpack-cookbook](https://github.com/christianalfoni/react-webpack-cookbook/wiki). Check it out if you want to know more about Webpack and React.

The purpose of this cookbook is to guide you into the world of Angular and Webpack. Both are powerful technologies and when used together, frontend development becomes a joy.

The cookbook should have something to offer for all skill levels. If you are interested in just Angular, skip the Webpack part and vice versa.

## Angular

From the [AngularJS docs](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/introduction): AngularJS is a structural framework for dynamic web apps. It lets you use HTML as your template language and lets you extend HTML's syntax to express your application's components clearly and succinctly. Angular's data binding and dependency injection eliminate much of the code you would otherwise have to write. And it all happens within the browser, making it an ideal partner with any server technology.

We're particularly concerned with [Directives](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/directive), which allow us to use Angular to build components. 

## Webpack

Webpack operates on a lower level. It is a module bundler. In essence it is something that you use to build your project into deliverable components (HTML, CSS, JS). The nice thing about Webpack is that once you initially configure it, it deals with the nasty details for you. This allows you to mix various technologies within your project without a headache.

If you are completely new to Webpack and want to go through a good introduction, check out [Pete Hunt's guide](https://github.com/petehunt/webpack-howto). You'll find the basics there. This guide merely complements his.
